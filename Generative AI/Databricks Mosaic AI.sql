-- MAGIC * Databricks acquired MosaicML
-- MAGIC * A leading platform for creating and customizing generative AI models for enterprises
-- MAGIC * They keep using the term so I'm gonna repeat the full sentence: _"Democratize data and AI for every enterprise"_
-- MAGIC * to provide the best-in-class experience for training, customizing, and deploying generative AI applications
-- MAGIC * The three most important developments required to move generative AI into the mainstream for enterprises
-- MAGIC     * models are widely available to every company
-- MAGIC     * reduce the price of training and customizing large language models
-- MAGIC     * training and serving costs
-- MAGIC     * Open LLMs: popular [MPT-7B](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-7b) and [MPT-30B](https://huggingface.co/mosaicml/mpt-30b) base LLMs
-- MAGIC     * AI applications with reasoning abilities and language-based interfaces
-- MAGIC     * incorporate the large volumes of custom data: information about business processes, customers, accounts, orders, or other aspects of their business
-- MAGIC     * Data privacy and safety
-- MAGIC     * little tolerance for hallucinations or incorrect responses
-- MAGIC     * deploy safe, secure, and effective AI applications
-- MAGIC     * Unifying the AI and data stack
-- MAGIC     * model development life cycle
-- MAGIC     * Databricks to continue to put data at the center of the AI journey
-- MAGIC     * upstream data preparation like cleaning, featurization, and embedding of data for use in models
