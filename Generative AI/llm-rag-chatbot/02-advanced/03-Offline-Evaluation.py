# MAGIC # 3/ Evaluating the RAG Chat Bot with LLMs-as-a-Judge for automated evaluation

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that our RAG model is deployed, we aim to evaluate its predictions correctness.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Evaluating LLMs can be challenging as existing benchmarks and metrics can not measure them comprehensively. Humans are often involved in these tasks (see [RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback), but it doesn't scale well: humans are slow and expensive!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Introducing LLM-as-a-Judge
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this notebook, we'll automate the evaluation process with a trending approach in the LLM community: **LLMs-as-a-judge**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Faster and cheaper than human evaluation, LLM-as-a-Judge leverages an external agent who judges the generative model predictions given what is expected from it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Superior models are typically used for such evaluation (e.g. `llama2-70B` judges `llama2-7B`, or `GPT4` judges `llama2-70B`)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll explore the new LLMs-as-a-judges evaluation methods introduced in MLflow 2.9, with its powerful `mlflow.evaluate()`API.+

# MAGIC ### Creating an external model endpoint with Azure Open AI as a judge

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks Serving Endpoint can be of 3 types:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Your own models, deployed as an endpoint (a chatbot model, your custom fine tuned LLM)
# MAGIC - Fully managed, serverless Foundation Models (e.g. llama2, MPT...)
# MAGIC - An external Foundation Model (e.g. Azure OpenAI)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's create a external model endpoint using Azure Open AI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Note that you'll need to change the values with your own Azure Open AI configuration. Alternatively, you can setup a connection to another provider like OpenAI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Note: If you don't have an Azure OpenAI deployment, this demo will fallback to a Databricks managed llama 2 model. Evaluation won't be as good.*

# MAGIC ## Offline LLM evaluation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will start with offline evaluation, scoring our model before its deployment. This requires a set of questions we want to ask to our model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In our case, we are fortunate enough to have a labeled training set (questions+answers)  with state-of-the-art technical answers from our Databricks support team. Let's leverage it so we can compare our RAG predictions and ground-truth answers in MLflow.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Note**: This is optional! We can benefit from the LLMs-as-a-Judge approach without ground-truth labels. This is typically the case if you want to evaluate "live" models answering any customer questions

# MAGIC ##LLMs-as-a-judge: automated LLM evaluation with out of the box and custom GenAI metrics
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLflow 2.8 provides out of the box GenAI metrics and enables us to make our own GenAI metrics:
# MAGIC - Mlflow will automatically compute relevant task-related metrics. In our case, `model_type='question-answering'` will add the `toxicity` and `token_count` metrics.
# MAGIC - Then, we can import out of the box metrics provided by MLflow 2.8. Let's benefit from our ground-truth labels by computing the `answer_correctness` metric. 
# MAGIC - Finally, we can define customer metrics. Here, creativity is the only limit. In our demo, we will evaluate the `professionalism` of our Q&A chatbot.

# MAGIC ## Conclusion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks AI makes it easy to evaluate your LLM Models, leveraging custom metrics.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Evaluating your chatbot is key to measure your future version impact, and your Data Intelligence Platform makes it easy leveraging automated Workflow for your MLOps pipelines.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For a production-grade GenAI application, this step should be automated and part as a job, executed everytime the model is changed and benchmarked against previous run to make sure you don't have performance regression.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Next: Deploy our model as Model Serving Endpoint with Inference Tables and deploy LLM metric monitoring (live monitoring)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open the [04-Deploy-Model-as-Endpoint]($./04-Deploy-Model-as-Endpoint) to deploy your model and track your endpoint payload as a Delta Table.
